# 4-bit-Multiplier-using-Modified-Booth-Algorithm

The idea of this design is to implement the modified Booth algorithm to create 4 bit SFQ multiplier. In more detail, we have designed a 4-bit multiplier based on radix-4 Booth method. With this method, the number of partial products decreases down to the half compared to the conventional Booth encoder. After having 2 partial products, a 6-bit Carry Look Ahead Adder is used for taking the sum to get the final result of the multiplication. Hardware Description Language VHDL is used in this design.
